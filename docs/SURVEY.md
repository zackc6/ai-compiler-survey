## 0. Executive verdict

Compilation is shifting from **fixed pass pipelines + black-box autotuning** toward **hybrid LLM–compiler loops**. Empirically, the winning pattern is:

> **Agents own semantic search, orchestration, and artifact synthesis. Compilers own lowering, legality, measurement, and fallback.**

Agents are reshaping the **control plane** of compilation more than replacing the **data plane**. Production default adoption and strong correctness oracles remain the main gaps.

## 1. What’s the trend now? (Q1)

### 1.1 Two stacks converging

| Stack | Question it answers | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| Compilers for AI | How do we lower neural graphs to GPUs/TPUs efficiently? | Mature substrate (TVM/XLA/MLIR/Triton); still fragmented |
| AI for compilers | How do we choose passes, write heuristics/kernels, use feedback? | Rapid 2023–2026 growth; hybrid systems dominate |

“Next generation” is not “throw away LLVM/MLIR.” It is **making those stacks agent-addressable**: structured summaries, bounded candidate spaces, tool APIs, and reward oracles.

### 1.2 Era timeline

| Era | Label | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 2018–2022 | DL compilers mature | TVM/Ansor, XLA, Glow; MLIR born from TF/XLA needs; cost-model autotune |
| 2020–2023 | ML-for-compiler RL | Autophase, CompilerGym, MLGO inlining/regalloc; neural policies hard to ship |
| 2023–2024 | LLM enters IR | Pass-list LLMs; Meta LLM Compiler foundation models; compiler feedback loops |
| 2025–2026 | Agentic hybrid era | Multi-agent tuners, verifier-RL, heuristic synthesis, Triton kernel agents, generative compilation, vendor CompileIQ / GEAK |

### 1.3 Six active trends (detailed)

#### Trend A — Hybrid guidance, not LLM-as-compiler

Direct LLM IR rewrite is repeatedly fragile. mlirAgent reports frontier models scoring **below identity** on IR transforms. Systems that succeed constrain the LLM:

- **AgentCompile:** LLM emits advisory metadata only; templates + checks + benchmarks admit CUDA.
- **HintPilot:** LLM inserts compiler-validated pragmas/attributes, not arbitrary rewrites.
- **Meta LLM Compiler / Compiler-R1:** LLM proposes pass sequences; `opt` applies them.

#### Trend B — From RL gyms to LLM agents

CompilerGym exposed LLVM passes as OpenAI Gym environments (Autophase features, IR instruction-count rewards). That lowered the barrier for RL researchers but policies were often opaque and brittle across compiler versions.

2024–26 shifts toward:

1. **Foundation models** pretrained on IR/asm (Meta LLM Compiler: 546B tokens).
2. **Tool-using agents** trained with SFT+RL (Compiler-R1).
3. **Inference-only multi-agent tuners** that avoid heavy offline training (AutoPass).
4. **Program-synthesis of heuristics** that land as ordinary C++ (Magellan), recovering deployability that neural-in-the-compiler lacked.

#### Trend C — MLIR + Triton as default substrate

Practical GenAI path today:

```text
PyTorch → Dynamo/Inductor → Triton → PTX/CUDA (or CUDA Tile IR)
```

Parallel portable path:

```text
Framework → StableHLO → XLA or IREE → device backends
```

MLIR remains the shared engineering substrate even when product branding differs (OpenXLA, Triton internals, vendor AI compilers, CIRCT). Industry critique (Modular/Lattner) notes fragmentation and that open MLIR AI dialects have not always matched CUDA peak for LLM inference—hence Triton, CUTLASS, FlashAttention, and now CUDA Tile / CompileIQ.

#### Trend D — Kernel agents go industrial

Writing GPU kernels is the bottleneck for new model architectures and non-NVIDIA portability.

- **KernelBench (ICML 2025):** 250 PyTorch tasks; metric `fast_p` = correct **and** faster than baseline. Frontier models still often <20% one-shot; iterative refinement helps.
- **KernelBench-X:** refinement raises correctness but can **hurt** average speedup; many correct kernels still lose to eager; fusion tasks remain hard.
- **GEAK (AMD):** generator/evaluator/reflector/optimizer loop for Triton on Instinct; reported up to ~63% execution accuracy and ~2.59× speedup on suites.
- **Meta KernelLLM:** 8B model specialized for PyTorch→Triton; competitive Pass@k vs much larger general models on KernelBench-Triton.
- **AgentCompile:** compiler-bounded CUDA specialization for transformer inference graphs.

#### Trend E — Verification enters the loop

Correctness strategies, from weakest to strongest (local):

1. Compile + unit tests / LLM-generated tests (ACCLAIM).
2. Numerical checks vs reference path (AgentCompile).
3. Round-trip / recompile checks (LLM Compiler disassembly).
4. Formal semantic equivalence (Alive2 in LLM-VeriOpt rewards).

Formal coverage is still mostly **local peephole / IR**. Whole-program GPU races and FP nondeterminism lack equally strong oracles.

#### Trend F — Compilers broaden their object

- **Generative Compilation:** sealors complete partial Rust so the compiler can diagnose **during** LLM decoding—not only after file completion.
- **Compiler.next:** treat FMware (prompts, agents, free parameters) as a multi-objective search/compile problem for SE 3.0.
- **Anthropic Claude C Compiler:** agent teams *build a compiler* (~100kLoC Rust) capable of Linux kernel builds—adjacent but important: agents as compiler engineers, not only compile-time optimizers.
- **Magellan / AlphaEvolve:** agents rewrite the heuristic C++ inside production compilers (Google reports production inlining usage and XLA experiments).

## 2. How do agents help AI compilation? (Q2)

### 2.1 Mechanisms (why it works)

1. **Sample efficiency** — Language priors propose plausible schedules/passes instead of blind evolutionary samples (Reasoning Compiler vs MetaSchedule-style search).
2. **Correctness envelope** — Constraining interventions to hints, templates, verified IR, or pass lists avoids unconstrained codegen failures.
3. **Multi-level creativity** — Compilers miss purpose-level rewrites; LLMs can restructure algorithms when tests gate acceptance (ACCLAIM).
4. **Compiler engineering itself** — Agents write maintainable heuristics/passes (Magellan, mlirAgent) rather than shipping opaque neural nets inside `opt`.
5. **Feedback densification** — Profilers, compiler diagnostics, Alive2, and Fast Feedback turn sparse rewards into iterative refine loops.

### 2.2 Closed loop (canonical)

See [`TAXONOMY.md`](TAXONOMY.md). Variants:

| Variant | Twist |
|---|---|
| Generative Compilation | Feedback mid-decode via sealors |
| Reasoning Compiler | LLM proposals expand MCTS nodes |
| Magellan | Evolutionary mutate of C++ heuristics + Vizier autotune |
| ACCLAIM | Multi-level budgeted agents + test agent |
| GEAK | Reflexion-style generate–eval–reflect–optimize on GPU |
| CompileIQ | Evolutionary search over **compiler internal knobs** (not source) |

### 2.3 What agents should *not* own

- Unchecked IR/assembly emission as production code without admit gates.
- Silent replacement of numerical kernels without golden or statistical checks.
- Orchestration without reliable tool-calling (ACCLAIM: open models fail on malformed tool calls before code quality).

## 3. Can agents reshape compilation processes? (Q3)

**Short answer:** Yes for the **control plane**; no (so far) for wholesale replacement of deterministic lowering.

### 3.1 Old → new process map

| Legacy process | Agent-reshaped process | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed `-O2/-O3/-Oz` pipelines | Per-program pass search with LLM/RL policies | Compiler-R1, AwareCompiler, AutoPass, LLM Compiler |
| Hand-tuned heuristics in C++ | Agents synthesize/evolve heuristic code | Magellan (LLVM inlining/regalloc; XLA) |
| Black-box evolutionary autotune | Context-aware LLM proposals + structured search | Reasoning Compiler (TVM + MCTS) |
| Compile → fail → human fix | Compiler feedback during partial generation | Generative Compilation |
| Experts write Triton/CUDA | Agent generate–eval–reflect–optimize | GEAK, KernelBench agents, KernelLLM |
| Single IR level optimization | Multi-agent choose abstraction level | ACCLAIM |
| Compile source → binary | Compile intent / FMware knobs | Compiler.next (vision) |
| Generic NVCC heuristics | Per-kernel evolutionary compiler controls | NVIDIA CompileIQ |
| Humans write the compiler | Agent teams implement a C compiler | Anthropic CCC (engineering experiment) |

### 3.2 Hard limits

1. **Direct IR transformation** by LLMs can underperform identity; search/heuristic synthesis wins more reliably (mlirAgent).
2. **KernelBench-X:** iterative refine can raise pass rates while average speedup falls; ~46% of correct kernels still slower than eager in their setting.
3. **Tool-calling quality** of open models can break multi-agent compilers before code skill does (ACCLAIM).
4. **Formal verifiers** cover local equivalences; they do not yet bless end-to-end GPU serving stacks.
5. **Cost & reproducibility** of agent compile loops (tokens, nondeterminism, hardware noise) remain open (Compiler.next call-to-action).

### 3.3 Practical architecture recommendation

Design agent-shaped compilers as:

```text
bounded candidate spaces
+ structured IR / region summaries
+ advisory LLM
+ deterministic materialize
+ empirical and/or formal admit
+ fallback
```

Split **offline** compiler-engineering agents (Magellan-style heuristic synthesis) from **online** compile-time agents (HintPilot / AgentCompile / CompileIQ).

## 4. What’s missing? (Q4)

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Production default path | Few agents are default in Inductor/XLA/LLVM trunk |
| Correctness coverage | Alive2 local; GPU/FP/whole-program oracles thin |
| Cost & reproducibility | Token burn, sampling noise, hardware variance |
| Benchmark fragmentation | CompilerGym vs PolyBench vs KernelBench vs serving e2e |
| IR/dialect data scarcity | MLIR/Triton/Tile IR corpora << Python/C |
| Tool-calling reliability | Orchestration fails before optimization |
| Cross-stack agent APIs | No standard contract for regions/constraints/rewards |
| Human maintenance | Agent-written heuristics/kernels need ownership & security review |
| Multi-objective serving | Latency/throughput/memory/quality rarely co-optimized |
| FMware compile maturity | Intent/prompt/agent compilation still early |

### Follow-on questions for an org adopting this

1. Online compile-time agents (HintPilot/AgentCompile/CompileIQ) vs offline heuristic synthesis (Magellan)?
2. What is the correctness oracle—Alive2, golden kernels, or serving A/B?
3. Which IR is the agent contract—LLVM IR, MLIR dialect, Triton, StableHLO, CUDA Tile IR?
4. How do you cache and regress agent compile traces across compiler upgrades?
